      <h2><span id=NAME>NAME</span></h2>
      The group's name BTS is an acronym for the Korean expression Bangtan Sonyeondan (Hangul: 방탄소년단; Hanja: 防彈少年團), literally meaning "Bulletproof Boy Scouts". In Japan, they are known as Bōdan Shōnendan (防弾少年団), which translates to the same. On July 2017, BTS announced that in addition to being known as Bangtan Sonyeondan or Bulletproof Boy Scouts, the acronym would also stand for "Beyond The Scene" as part of their new brand identity.[27]

      In early 2017, BTS embarked on their Live Trilogy Episode III: The Wings Tour. That February, pre-orders for the repackaged edition of Wings, entitled You Never Walk Alone, reached over 700,000 copies.[87] The lead single "Spring Day" (Korean: 봄날; RR: Bomnal) topped eight of the major South Korean online music charts, as well as Gaon,[88] and crashed Melon's digital chart due to the high influx of user traffic.[89] It also entered the US Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart at number 15 with "zero promotions".[90] The music video surpassed 9 million views within 24 hours,[91] breaking "Blood, Sweat, and Tears' " record. A week later, the music video for their second single "Not Today" overtook "Spring Day"'s record with 10 million views.[92] Similarly, "Spring Day" became the fastest K-pop group music video to reach 20 million views, achieving the feat in less than four days; "Not Today" bested it in less than three.[93]
      In May 2017, they won the Top Social Artist Award at the Billboard Music Awards, becoming the first Korean group to win a BBMA.[22][23]
